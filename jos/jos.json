Specifically, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had included the inter-domain routing security in the national strategy of US information security. In recent years, innovation and evolution of the Internet are significantly frustrated by the IP spoofing based distributed denial of service attacks, most of which are inter-domain and transnational.

Therefore, friend recommendation should be focused on expanding the scale of social network and obtaining information form recommended friends. However, existing friend recommendation methods barely consider the people information need, and they are mainly based on the simple and limited user profiles, and are agnostic to users' offline behaviors in the real world. Because human activity in the physical world has a spatial locality, the recommended friends through the existing recommendation methods are limited in geographic space which the target user know. As a result, the recommendation cannot provide more new information on geography to meet the target's need on information. This paper first proposes a new friend recommendation method based on the offline check-in behaviors in the real world instead of the online user profiles, and mines check-in behavior similarity between users in the real world. The essential goal of friend recommendation is to provide users with more new information. In order to meet the requirements of user getting more geographical location information, the recommendation systems can recommend the strangers in broader check-in geography distribution for the target users. Meanwhile, when the recommended friends and the target users have the similar check-in behaviors, it is more probable for the users to accept recommended strangers. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is used to estimate each user's check-in behavior probability distribution and the time entropy to filtering some noise that have side effects on overall check-in behavior similarity, then the recommended strangers who can bring a wider range of new strangers geographic information for the target users are selected. Lastly, a large-scale user check-in data-set of Foursquare is used to validate recommendation precision and the degree of information expanding of this approach.

To reduce the repair network cost, the regenerating code and locally repairable codes were proposed, and simple regenerating code is a representative of the locally repairable codes. However, most of the current fault-tolerant distributed storage methods based on coding strategy assume that the storage nodes are located in the star shaped logic network, ignoring the physical network topology and link bandwidth capacity. So with applying the physical network topology into the repair process of erasure code and regenerating code, some related researches propose methods of building tree shaped repair paths to get further more efficiency for repairing a failed node.

To address the problems, this paper uses the feedback control theory to investigate the relationship among virtual network embeddings, and the impact of current mapping on active resources of substrate network. A novel multi-feedback control model and an algorithm are proposed for energy-efficient virtual network embedding.

This method helps eliminate the interferences on the minimum set of active substrate resources. In addition, a local feedback control for mapping virtual nodes and links is designed to reduce the number of active hibernating substrate links. As a result, the minimum set of substrate resource for one virtual network can be searched. Using this model, a smaller set of substrate nodes and links can be found for virtual network requests, which increase the number of passive hibernating nodes and links and decreases the energy consumption of substrate network. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed algorithm to be effective.

This paper focuses on the impact of DVFS on performance of an application and proposes an analytical model to quantitatively characterize the relationship between an application's performance and a processor's frequency, which can be leveraged to predict the performance of an application at any frequency. Specifically, according to different memory subsystem resources accessed, instructions of an application are divided into two parts:on-chip instructions and off-chip instructions, which can be modeled independently. On-Chip instructions refer to instructions which only access on-chip resources, and their execution time is frequency-relevant and can be modeled using a linear function. Off-chip instructions stand for instructions accessing the main memory, and their execution time is dominated by memory access latency and is frequency- irrelevant. By the division and modeling of the two parts, a quantitative model can be obtained between the execution time of an application and frequency of a processor.

However, those methods have following limitations:(1) They require human intervention to label some attributes, values and the matching relationship between them; (2) The matching accuracy may be greatly affected by language habits, semantic logic, and the quality of corpus and candidates sets. To address these issues, this paper proposes an unsupervised approach for attribute name and value extraction and matching in Chinese textual merchandise descriptions. Taking advantage of search engine, it extracts the candidate set of attribute names with respect to a value by analyzing grammatical relation based on the principle of small probability event. A new algorithm for computing the matching probability between attribute names and values is also designed based on relative conditional deselect probability and Page Rank. The proposed approach can effectively extract attribute names and values from Chinese textual merchandise descriptions and match them without any human intervention, no matter whether the attribute name appears in the textual description or not. Finally, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the textual descriptions of 4 types of merchandise using the search engine of Baidu. The experimental results show that the new approach for attribute name extraction can improve recall by 20%, compared with the approach of directly extracting attribute names from textual descriptions.

CCA requires the data be rigorously paired or one-to-one correspondence among different views due to its correlation definition.

Often, only a few paired and a lot of unpaired multi-view data are given, because unpaired multi-view data are relatively easier to be collected and pairing them is difficult, time consuming and even expensive. Such data is referred as semi-paired multi-view data. When facing semi-paired multi-view data, CCA usually performs poorly. To tackle this problem, a semi-paired variant of CCA, named SemiPCCA, is proposed based on the probabilistic model for CCA. The actual meaning of \"semi-\" in SemiPCCA is \"semi-paired\" rather than \"semi-supervised\" as in popular semi-supervised learning literature. The estimation of SemiPCCA model parameters is affected by the unpaired multi-view data which reveal the global structure within each modality. By using artificially generated semi-paired multi-view data sets, the experiment shows that SemiPCCA effectively overcome the over-fitting problem of traditional CCA and PCCA (probabilistic CCA) under the condition of insufficient paired multi-view data and performs better than the original CCA and PCCA.

Many research works show that, assuming that RSA problem and their variants are difficult, it is difficult to prove the RSA-OAEP schemes or their improvements secure against adaptive chosen cipher-text attack in the standard model. In addition, because these schemes encrypt randomized message using padding mechanism, the randomized message is k-bit longer than the plain-text. This increases the computational complexity of these schemes. To address the problem, this paper proposes an RSA-type encryption scheme based pairing functions. This scheme has the following advantages. First, the scheme does not use hash function to hide the statistical property of plain-text, which makes it possible to prove its security in the standard model. In this scheme, the randomized message can be shorter than the plain-text. Second, it is proved in the standard model that the scheme is secure against adaptive chosen cipher-text attacks.

Current UAV based data collection schemes, however, focus on how to maximize the quantity of the data with limited energy, but lack the consideration of the data value, and hence perform poorly in the energy efficiency of UAV . So how to achieve the maximum data value while the consumed energy of UAV is minimum?

In view of this problem, this paper proposes a new method of speech emotion feature extraction with unsupervised auto-encoding network to learn emotional feature in speech signal automatically. By constructing a 3-layer auto-encoding network to extract the speech emotional feature, the high level feature is used as the input of extreme learning machine classifier to make final recognition.

Up to date, the majority of the existing professional modeling tools take expensive measured data to build sophisticated 3D geological models, and usually suffer from the drawbacks of time-consuming and difficult to learn and use. Therefore, this paper exploits the intuitiveness of \"paper-pencil\" metaphor and develops a complete sketch-based interactive geological modeling framework, including 3D sketching, surfacing and sketch-based model editing. Geological sketches can be drawn on user-defined 3D drawing planes. Intersecting sketches constitute a sketch network, from which the corresponding 3D model is generated on the fly with the surface patching method. Specifically, surface patching employs the idea of divide-and-conquer and takes three steps. Based on the topology of the sketch network, planar cycles are first collected by minimizing their geometric energies, i.e. the corners . Then, surface patches are generated for each cycle by Laplacian optimization of the target mean curvatures and normals, which are pre-computed by harmonic functions. Finally, surface patches are stitched to make a complete 3D model. Geological phenomena such as folding and faulting can be modeled by over-sketching and cutting operations, respectively. In addition, the hierarchy of models is preserved in a hierarchical tree structure. To maintain the contact between geo-bodies, the deformation of an edited model is automatically transferred to its siblings and parents on the basis of their hierarchies. Compared to the existing sketch-based modeling tools, awareness of the geological knowledge makes the method advantageous in effectively describing geo-bodies with fewer expressive sketches.

Due to the inherent hardware limitation, the randomness of distribution environment and unconscious errors during data processing, a deluge of missing values are mingled in original sensing data. Thus, imputing the missing values is essential because most of the existed analysis tools are not competent to the data sets containing missing values. So far, there have been many missing data imputation algorithms, however the accuracy of these algorithms is difficult to be guaranteed in the scenario of lumped missing data. Besides, these existing algorithms don't take the imputation order which influences the imputation accuracy into consideration. To address the above issues, this paper proposes an order-sensitive missing value imputation framework called OMSMVI for multi-source sensory data. OMSMVI takes advantages of multi-dimensions relevancy, such as temporal relevancy, spatial relevancy and attributive relevancy of sensing data adequately. The missing-sources-centered similarity graphs are constructed based on multi-dimensions relevancy. At the same time, in the process of missing data imputation, the imputed missing values are used as observations to impute subsequent missing values. Taking the whole distribution of missing sources into consideration, the framework performs order-sensitive missing value imputation, meaning that the order of imputation is ascertained before applying the specific MVI (missing value imputation) methods. Order-sensitive imputation can remit the decrease of imputed result accuracy caused by the lower similarity between missing source and its neighbors when the missing sources are dense. Finally, a new neighborhood-based missing values imputation algorithm NI, which modifies the KNN imputation algorithm, is introduced into the OMSMVI framework. NI uses the multi-dimension similarity to search the missing sources' neighbors which reflect the similarity from multiple dimensions. Such NI algorithm overcomes the shortcoming that parameter K of KNN is difficult to determine. Furthermore, NI algorithm can improve the imputation accuracy further compared to KNN.

Effective monitoring technique towards Web QoS, which is an important measure of third-party service quality, is necessary to ensure quality control on Web service. Several monitoring approaches have been proposed, however none of them consider the influences of environment including the position of server and user usage, and the load at runtime. Ignoring these influences, which exist among the real-time monitoring process, may cause monitoring approaches to produce wrong results. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new environment sensitive Web QoS monitoring approach, called wBSRM (weighted Bayes runtime monitoring), based on weighted naive Bayes and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). The proposed approach is inspired by machine learning classification algorithm, and measures influence of environment factor by TF-IDF algorithm. It constructs weighted naïve Bayes classifier by learning part of samples to classify monitoring results. The results that meet QoS standard are classified as c 0 , and those that do not meet is classified as c 1 . Classifier can output ratio between posterior probability of c 0 and c 1 , and the analysis can lead to three monitoring results including c 0 , c 1 or inconclusive.

Firstly, reachable interval is proposed to efficiently measure the anonymization cost incurred by an edge addition.

In order to balance energy consumption of nodes, this paper utilizes a mobile data collector to collect data in the network, and proposes an algorithm named DC-Collection to solve the problem of minimizing data collection delay and energy consumption. First, DC-Collection constructs a shortest path tree. If the network is not connected, there are more than one shortest path trees (i.e., there is a set of shortest path trees in the network). Second, some nodes in the trees are selected as collective nodes or lingering nodes, where a collective node is the root of a height-limited tree that will receive data sent from its descendant nodes and a lingering node is a normal node that the mobile data collector will visit at a given time to collect sensing data. The mobile data collector can collect the data of all nodes in the network as long as it traverses the locations of all lingering nodes. The heights of the trees that rooted at the collective nodes are limited to be smaller than h . There is at least a lingering node exists in the communication area of each collective node. Third, DC-Collection adjusts the structures of the height-limited trees. It makes nodes with higher energy level possess more descendants, so as to maximize the network lifetime by balancing the energy consumption of nodes. Finally, the mobile data collector starts from a Sink, and traverses locations of the lingering nodes in sequence to collect data. After collecting all the data, it returns to the starting point and uploads the data to the Sink. Compared with existing algorithms, theoretical analyses and simulations show that DC-Collection can not only balance the energy consumption of nodes to prolong the network lifetime, but also shorten the path length that the mobile data collector walks to reduce the data collection delay.", "fname_chs": "传感网中延迟限定的非汇聚数据移动式收集"}}, {"dname": "混合云中面向数据中心的工作流数据布局方法", "durl": "http://www.jos.org.cn/ch/reader/download_pdf.aspx?file_no=4879&year_id=2016&quarter_id=7&falg=1", "dInfo": {"abst_chs": "科学工作流是一种复杂的数据密集型应用程序.如何在混合云环境中对数据进行有效布局,是科学工作流所面临的重要问题,尤其是混合云的安全性要求给科学云工作流数据布局研究带来了新的挑战.传统数据布局方法大多采用基于负载均衡的划分模型布局数据集,该方法可以获得很好的负载平衡布局,然而传输时间并非最优.针对传统数据布局方法的不足,并结合混合云中数据布局的特点,首先设计一种基于数据依赖破坏度的矩阵划分模型,生成对数据依赖度破坏最小的划分;然后提出一种面向数据中心的数据布局方法,该方法依据划分模型将依赖度高的数据集尽量放在同一数据中心,从而减少数据集跨数据中心的传输时间.实验结果表明,该方法能够有效地缩短科学工作流运行时跨数据中心的数据传输时间.", "fname_en": "Datacenter-Oriented Data Placement Strategy of Workflows in Hybrid Cloud", "abst_en": "Scientific workflow is a complicated data intensive application.

Combining with the characteristics of sensor data itself and its application, a strategy is proposed based on changing the frequency of assessing source reliability to reduce the iterative processes, and therefore to improve the efficiency of truth discovery in multiple-source sensor data streams. First, definitions are provided on when the relative errors and accumulative errors are relatively small, and the necessary conditions of the variation on source reliability from adjacent time points. Next, a probabilistic model is given to predict the probability of meeting these necessary conditions. Then, by integrating the above conclusions, maximal assessing period of source reliability is achieved, under the condition that the cumulative error of prediction is smaller than the given threshold in a certain confidence level of probabilities, in order to improve efficiency. Thus the truth discovery problem is transformed into an optimization problem. Furthermore, an algorithm, CTF-Stream (continuous truth finding over sensor data streams) is constructed to assessing source reliability with changeable frequencies. CTF-Stream utilizes the historic data to dynamically determine the time needed to assess the source reliability, and finds the truth with a certain accuracy given by customers while improving the efficiency.

As a bonus, secret data can be embedded directly in homomorphic encrypted domain by altering the target pixels with the fake pixels which are comprised of secret data.

Changing source program might not only affect the program structure and result in errors, but also be hard to implement automatically. To solve the problem, this paper presents an approach of test case generation based on combination of schema using particle swarm optimization. First, a definition called \"schema\" is presented for all the branches which are able to improve the fitness value, and the branch function of the schema is obtained, solving the problem of partial evaluation. Then, a crossover is designed to place search on all the individuals which have the minimum value of branch function of the schema. The crossover views each schema as a whole and combines all the schemata into a single individual, as a result the crossover can not only prevent schemata destroyed in the process of evolution, but also improve the fitness value of individuals because of the combination. Furthermore, a local search strategy is used for the best particle in each generation in the process of test case generation.

First, the multiple bugs' localization is converted into a search based model and a candidate expression for multiple bugs' location is encoded as an individual binary string.

According to this order, programmers finally examine program entities to locate faults.

For large system production lines, such as cyber physical system(CPS) product lines, there are usually hundreds and thousands of configurable parameters, hundreds of conformance constraints, and complicated dependencies among the conformance constraints. Thus it is very challenging to resolve nonconformities in an efficient manner. As a first step to address this challenge, an automated nonconformity resolving recommendation approach(Zen-Fix) was presented in the previous work by this research, which relies on multi-objective search and constraint solving techniques. To further improve the search efficiency in such interactive CPS configuration process, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called DeIBEA, which combines differential evolution with IBEA(indicator-based evolutionary algorithm), and distinguishes feasible solutions from infeasible ones, generating offspring through the differential operation. Integrating Zen-Fix with DeIBEA can recommend nonconformity-free yet optimal solutions to configuration engineers. The cost effectiveness of DeIBEA(in the context of Zen-Fix) is empirically evaluated with a real-world case study, in which a configuration process is simulated containing 10189 search problems.

constraints;hill climbing often sticks at local optima, which limits yielding of high-coverage cases;and simulated annealing and genetic algorithm need complicated configuration, which make the results unstable.In this paper, a novel test generation approach that is guided by linear fitting is proposed.The basis of the approach is to sample every decision and condition of numerical values with program instrumentation.The relationship of inputs and samples is then build with linear fitting functions.By searching the target inputs on the gradually refined functions, test case is generated with high coverage.Experiments on 25 real programs in open source projects show that the proposed approach is more effective and efficient than the genetic algorithm of test generation.",

A program invariant is a set of properties of program. Normally, the invariant holds during runtime. But when soft error occurs, the invariant is often violated due to the impact of soft error. Based on this principle, invariant-based asserts are inserted into source code. Once an exception is thrown by an assert, it indicates that soft error is detected. By analyzing the propagation of the fault that leads to SDC, the locations where asserts are embedded are selected and then invariants are extracted. Some of the invariants are converted to asserts based on their permeability, which indicates the capabilities of detecting soft error.

In this method, the images are classified into different groups through an improved k -means clustering algorithm according to image similarities. When a new image is entered, a sampling method is used to choose an appropriate group to perform the deduplication operation. Experiments show that this approach is robust and effective.

In recent years, Boolean algorithms based on triangular polyhedron show the distinct advantages aligning with the development of graphic hardware, as their outputs can be processed by graphic hardware directly. But most existing methods rely on constructive solid geometry (CSG) tree localized evaluation strategy to perform regularized set operations. As a result, these methods cannot guarantee robustness while synchronously keeping high efficiency, because a facet may repeatedly split up in the splitting phase and the facets classification is carried out between the split polyhedrons by triangulation. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to realize robust, exact and fastregularized Boolean operations through CSG tree global evaluation strategy. The algorithm is comprised of two steps:adaptive lazy splitting and globalized facets classification. The two steps aim to optimize splitting and facets classification phases of the regularized Boolean algorithms on triangulated polyhedrons respectively. In the adaptive lazy splitting phase, we apply a lazy splitting strategy to the whole CSG tree by coping with all intersection cases of triangular facets in order to eliminate the accumulation of number errors. At the meantime, an adaptive octree is employed to speed up the intersection test process. In the globalized facets classification phase, to ensure the accuracy of classification, we always execute the classification method between the split facet and the original input polyhedrons by divide and conquer algorithm. The performance of classification is further optimized by combining the grouping classification strategy and the octree.

The proposed protocol uses two strategies to make queries balancing among inter-and intra-group peers. First a resource grouping and rewiring strategy is provided to periodically cluster peers having same set of resources. This grouping strategy makes locating resources more efficient in the inter-group peers, for it makes the network overlay topology evolve from a random network to a clustered network. The rewiring strategy also alleviates loads among over-loaded peers. Meanwhile, load balancing routing among the intragroup peers is achieved by collaborative Q -learning among peers. The collaborative Q -learning method not only learns from such parameters as processing capacity, number of connections and number of resources in peers, but also learns their state of congestion. Using this technique, queries are guided to avoid forwarding to those congested peers. Thus, query routing forwarding is balanced among intra-group peers.

Based on local requirement information, we provide three different kinds of on-demand replication strategies and a rare resource search algorithm.

It may cause the early death of some nodes and result in a short network lifetime. Mixed data transmission, which randomly propagates data one-hop or two-hop away in each step, has been developed for energy balancing. The performance of this scheme depends heavily on the setting of transmission probabilities. However, no general rules have been proposed to guide the calculation of these probabilities, and little study has done on whether the energy of all nodes are able to be balanced by this scheme, especially under the constraints of limited communication ranges. This paper formulates the problem of energy balancing as an optimal transmission probability allocation problem. It reveals that the transmission probability is mainly determined by the locations of each node; however, the values of the probability become invalid if the network size exceeds a threshold. This work theoretically investigates the energy balance conditions and presents guidelines for allocating the transmission probabilities. It proves that the global energy balance can be achieved if and only if the network size is not greater than n 0 . It further reveals that n 0 only depends on the communication profiles of the network. Such a profile is indicated by a newly discovered parameter, which is defined as the premium power ratio of the system. Finally, it extends the two-hop based mixed data transmission scheme to a general model and investigates the impact of the combinations of transmission ranges on energy balancing.

Intelligent trajectory prediction can not only provide accurate location-based services, but also monitor and estimate traffic to suggest the best path, and as such becomes an active research direction. Aiming to overcome the drawbacks of the existing methods, a new trajectory prediction model based on Gaussian mixture models called GMTP is proposed. The new model contains the following essential phases: (1) modeling the complex motion patterns based on Gaussian mixture models, (2) calculating the probability distribution of different types of motion patterns by using Gaussian mixture model in order to partition trajectory data into distinct components, and (3) inferring the most possible trajectories of moving objects via Gaussian process regression. The GMTP algorithm is naturally a Gaussian nonlinear statistical probability model and the advantage of the proposed model is that the result is not only a predicted value, but also a whole distribution beyond the future trajectories, therefore making it possible to infer the location in regard to some motion patterns, e.g., uniformly accelerated motion, by using statistical probability distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on real trajectory data sets and the results show that the prediction accuracy of the GMTP algorithm is improved by 22.2% and 23.8%, and the runtime can be reduced by 92.7% and 95.9% on average, respectively, when compared to the Gaussian process regression model and Kalman filter prediction algorithm with similar parameter setting.", "fname_chs": "一种基于高斯混合模型的轨迹预测算法"}}, {"dname": "云平台下基于粗糙集的并行增量知识更新算法", "durl": "http://www.jos.org.cn/ch/reader/download_pdf.aspx?file_no=4590&year_id=2015&quarter_id=5&falg=1", "dInfo": {"abst_chs": "日益复杂和动态变化的海量数据处理,是当前人们普遍关注的问题,其核心内容之一是研究如何利用已有的信息实现快速的知识更新.粒计算是近年来新兴的一个研究领域,是信息处理的一种新的概念和计算范式,主要用于描述和处理不确定的、模糊的、不完整的和海量的信息,以及提供一种基于粒与粒间关系的问题求解方法.作为粒计算理论中的一个重要组成部分,粗糙集是一种处理不确定性和不精确性问题的有效数学工具.根据云计算中的并行模型MapReduce,给出了并行计算粗糙集中等价类、决策类和两者之间相关性的算法;然后,设计了用于处理大规模数据的并行粗糙近似集求解算法.为应对动态变化的海量数据,结合MapReduce模型和增量更新方法,根据不同的增量策略,设计了两种并行增量更新粗糙近似集的算法.实验结果表明,该算法可以有效地快速更新知识;而且数据量越大,效果越明显.", "fname_en": "Parallel and Incremental Algorithm for Knowledge Update Based on Rough Sets in Cloud Platform", "abst_en": "The increasing complexity and dynamic change of massive data processing currently receive widespread attention.

It first maps various exceptions into 64-bit floating-point numbers, and then stages the handling process into three parts on basis of their kernel computations. These stages are input parameter detection, which handles INV exception, specific code detection, which handles DZE and INF exceptions, and output parameter detection, which handles FPF and DNO exceptions.

In this paper, the variance reduction issue in COMID (composite objective mirror descent) is addressed when solving non-smooth optimization problems.

Next, an adaptive factor based dynamic adjustment method for assistant associative classifier is proposed. This method can make full use of domain experts' real-time feedback to adjust classifier dynamically in the applying process of the used classifier, to improve its performance facing dynamic datasets, and to slow down its retraining frequency.

Existing nonlinear manifolds methods project each image into low dimensional space as a point, thus suffer from cluster alignment and un-sufficient sampling. In order to avoid the above flaws and make the margin clearer between manifolds, projecting matrices in new method are gotten by means of partitioning image into un-overlapping patches so that features extracted this way can be more discriminative. In addition, a method of similarity measure between manifolds is proposed in accordance with the patching scheme. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on several widely studied databases.

A series of algorithms have been proposed to process range queries of moving objects. However, these algorithms are either designed for fast response time or high update performance.
